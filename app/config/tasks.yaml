# CV Reader Task
#--------------------------------------------------
cv_reader_task:
  description: >
    1. Read all PDF CV files from the directory {pdf_files_path}.
    2. For each PDF CV file, extract its text content.
    3. Save the extracted text to a new .txt file in the directory {txt_output_path}.

    Use the following tools:
    - DirectoryReadTool: to list all PDF files in the specified folder.
    - PDFReaderTool: to extract text content from each PDF file and save it as a .txt file.

    Ensure that the output .txt files are named identically to their source PDF files,
    but with a .txt extension, and are stored in the specified output directory.
    DO NOT READ THE CONTENT, ONLY PASS IT TO THE TOOL, AND DO NOT GENERATE ANY ADDITIONAL OUTPUT.
  expected_output: >
    The word "Completed" after all PDF files are converted to txt files in {txt_output_path}

# # CV JSON Builder Task
# #--------------------------------------------------
# cv_json_builder_task:
#   description: >
#     Read the cleaned CV text file from the directory {txt_output_path} and
#     convert each CV text into a structured JSON profile that matches the
#     CVData schema. For every .txt CV file found, create a corresponding
#     .json file in the same or specified output directory.

#     Use the CV content to extract:
#     - personal_info (name, email, phone, location if available)
#     - summary
#     - skills (grouped into technical/soft if possible)
#     - experience (job title, company, dates, bullets)
#     - education
#     - certifications
#     - projects
#     - languages
#     - side_notes (any leftover info)

#     Keep "source_file" equal to the original CV file name, and save it in the (/preprocessed-CVs) folder.
#   expected_output: >
#     A JSON file per CV text found, each conforming to the CVData schema.

# # Task: Check Candidate Eligibility
# #--------------------------------------------------
# check_candidate_eligibility_task:
#   description: >
#     Compare the candidate profile JSON (CVData) with the job description JSON.
#     Determine if the candidate is appropriate for this job.

#     Steps to follow:
#     1. Read the candidate JSON (fields: personal_info, summary, skills,
#        experience, education, certifications, languages).
#     2. Read the job description JSON (fields: must_have_skills, nice_to_have_skills,
#        experience_required_years, education_required, location).
#     3. Check must-have skills: if any are completely missing from the candidate, flag them.
#     4. Check experience: compare candidate total relevant years to job requirement.
#     5. Check education: if the JD requires a specific degree and the candidate doesn't have it, flag it.
#     6. Based on these checks, decide: "APPROPRIATE" or "NOT APPROPRIATE".

#     This task is part of an automated HR pipeline and the output will be used
#     to filter candidates before human review.
#     {jd_file_path} contains the job description JSON file path.
#     and store the result in a json file.
#     and save the output file to (/results) folder.
#   expected_output: >
#     A JSON object with the following structure:
    
#       "decision": "APPROPRIATE" | "NOT_APPROPRIATE",
#       "match_score": <number 0-100>,
#       "missing_must_have_skills": [],
#       "missing_education": false,
#       "experience_gap_years": 0,
#       "notes": "short explanation of the decision"
